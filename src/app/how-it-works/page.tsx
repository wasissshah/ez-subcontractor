                                                    Don’t waste time chasing leads from Home owners. Connect with a verified General contractor and get more jobs. Sign up for free, no credit card required and start getting leads emailed and text to your phone in the radius area you choose to work. For one annual price you can obtain as many leads as you can handle with no per lead cost. With many other lead suppliers you can spend as much as $500 to $2000 per month just for the leads. With EZ Subcontractor you are getting leads from Verified General contractors. We know once you work for them and they like your work they will give you jobs directly and may not post the job, less competition and more work. But with our low price of $400 per year we know you will pay for another subscription because it is so low and why miss out on other projects by other General Contractors. Other websites like Thumbtack and Yelp, you end up competing with unlicensed contractors. Other websites dodge reports, Procore and plan Hub are primarily larger commercial jobs and require at least $500 to $1000 a month to subscribe. EZ Subcontractor is an easy way for Subcontractors to bid residential and commercial jobs for one low annual fee.

As a licensed General Contractor I started this site as I had a lot of trouble finding good reliable subcontractors for all my projects — plumbing, roofing, electrical, drywall and many other trades.
