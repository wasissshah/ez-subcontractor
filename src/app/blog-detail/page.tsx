                                        Homeowners are increasingly prioritizing sustainability, and builders are
                                        responding by choosing eco-friendly materials that reduce environmental impact.
                                        In 2025, recycled steel, bamboo flooring, reclaimed wood, and low-VOC paints are
                                        among the most sought-after materials. These not only lower carbon footprints
                                        but also improve indoor air quality and long-term energy performance.
